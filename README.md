# Compile Intel RealSense SDK from sources as part of the CMake build
This is a small example that demonstrates how the [Intel RealSense SDK](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense) can be compiled from sources only using CMake as part of the build.
During CMake configure step, the RealSense SDK sources are downloaded from the official GitHub-Repository and built from those sources.

Suggestions for improvements are welcome and appreciated.
